integration-ng
==============

Experiments on the evolution of integration.

This may eventually include: 

- **map-ng**: A language for message transformation.
- **dance-ng**: A language for message choreography.

For each one there could be:

- Parser definition.
- Analizer definition.
- Back-ends, such as, for map-ng: memory, JSON, XML; and for dance-ng: akka, zeromq, websocket.

Some of the inspiration comes from:

- XSLT and XQuery: The main transformation tools in XML
- RelaxNG: Simplified syntax and XML syntax
- Erlang: Actor model
- Scala: Functional/OO mixed style
- JavaScript: Protoype-based language
- Akka: Actors over Scala
- ZeroMQ: Socket-like async messaging
- Apache Camel: DSL for message-based integration 
- Clojure: Language-embedded STM
- Git: Distributed versioning
- Lisp: Code as data
